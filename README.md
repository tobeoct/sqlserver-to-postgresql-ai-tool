# SQLServer to PostgreSQL Migration Tool

## Overview

Welcome to the **SQLServer to PostgreSQL Migration Tool** repository. This comprehensive tool is designed to facilitate end-to-end migration from SQLServer to PostgreSQL, leveraging AI and various other technologies to ensure a seamless transition.

## Features

- **Application Migration**: Automatically refactor and migrate your application code to support PostgreSQL.
- **Schema Migration**: Efficiently convert SQLServer schemas to their PostgreSQL equivalents.
- **Data Migration**: Transfer your data accurately and efficiently.
- **SQLServer Business Logic Migration**: Convert and optimize SQLServer stored procedures, functions, and triggers for PostgreSQL.
- **Infrastructure Deployment**: Automate the deployment of PostgreSQL infrastructure.
- **High Availability Setup**: Set up PostgreSQL high availability (HA) configurations to ensure reliability and fault tolerance.

## Current Progress

At present, the tool has successfully implemented the following feature:
- **Stored Procedure Migration**: Utilizes ChatGPT to convert SQLServer stored procedures into PostgreSQL-compatible versions.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: The core language used for developing the tool.
- **AI (ChatGPT)**: Employed for intelligent migration of SQLServer stored procedures.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sqlserver-to-postgresql-migration-tool.git
    cd sqlserver-to-postgresql-migration-tool
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the stored procedure migration tool**:
    ```sh
    python migrate_stored_procedures.py --input path/to/sqlserver/procedures --output path/to/postgresql/procedures
    ```

## Roadmap
